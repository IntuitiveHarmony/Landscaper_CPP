# Landscaper C++

I will build this simple game to help solidify my understanding of some of the fundamental concepts when learning a new programming language.

## Finally!!

I have been waiting so long to put this together in C++

This is actually my third attempt at creating this game. I have previously built a few crude versions using JavaScipt and Python. I also utilized it as a means of familiarizing myself with the `useState()` hook in React.

Throughout this project, I consistently encountered the challenge of realizing the importance of patience. I tend to be impulsive and struggle with concentrating on fundamental concepts. My ultimate goal with C++ is to develop plugins for Digital Audio Workstations or standalone software based musical instruments. Consequently, while I know it is important, I often find it difficult to focus on tasks such as deleting a specific index from a vector because I am eager for my skillset to match my aspirations.
